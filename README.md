# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to provide the bank with the ability to determine whether or not a customer requesting a loan 
can be determined to be at risk of a default before making the loan. 

By using a machine learning model to predict a customer's credit worthiness, we can improve risk mitigation and minimize potential losses.
